    <script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"Wat is EASA en waarom is het belangrijk?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency) is de Europese luchtvaart veiligheidsautoriteit die uniform safety standards handhaaft across 31 EU en EFTA landen. Opgericht 2003 ter vervanging van gefragmenteerde nationale systemen, EASA centraliseert aircraft certification, airworthiness management, crew licensing, en operator approval. Voor PH-geregistreerde vliegtuigen betekent EASA compliance: (1) Automatisch vrij verkeer binnen EU/EFTA zonder extra permits per land. (2) Harmonized luchtwaardigheidsstandaarden ensuring consistent maintenance quality. (3) Mutual recognition crew licenses - Nederlandse pilots kunnen opereren EU-wide. (4) Type certificate acceptance - EASA-approved aircraft types geldig alle member states. (5) Simplified operations - single regulatory framework vs 31 verschillende nationale regelgevingen. EASA regulations generally strengere dan FAA certain areas (especially continuing airworthiness), maar provide long-term operational certainty en broad geographic acceptance. Nederlandse ILT is national aviation authority implementing EASA regulations domestically - all PH-registered aircraft must EASA compliant."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Wat is een Certificate of Airworthiness?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Certificate of Airworthiness (C of A, luchtwaardigheidsbe wijs) is fundamenteel document bewijzend aircraft type ontwerp gecertificeerd en individueel exemplaar voldoet productie standaarden. Issued eenmalig bij manufacture of import door type certificate holder authority (EASA voor Europese types, FAA voor Amerikaanse met EASA validation). C of A bevestigt: (1) Aircraft type heeft approved type certificate meeting EASA Certification Specifications (CS-23 light aircraft, CS-25 transport category jets). (2) Individueel aircraft gebouwd conform type design, proper materials/workmanship. (3) Initial airworthiness demonstrated via production inspection en test flight. C of A permanent geldig maar requires ongoing maintenance demonstreren continuing airworthiness - dit via Airworthiness Review Certificate (ARC). Major modifications kunnen C of A invalider tenzij approved via EASA Form 1 of STC (Supplemental Type Certificate). Export/import between authorities requires new C of A issuance - bijv. FAA-certified aircraft krijgt EASA C of A upon PH-registration. Kosten nieuwe C of A issuance €2.000-€10.000 depending aircraft complexity en required documentation/inspections. Aircraft zonder geldig C of A mag niet legal opereren - absolute vereiste voor registration en flight operations."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Hoe werkt de Airworthiness Review Certificate (ARC)?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"ARC (EASA Form 15c) demonstreert ongoing luchtwaardigheid via annual review continuing airworthiness compliance. Unlike C of A (eenmalig), ARC requires yearly renewal. Issued door EASA Part-M approved CAMO (Continuing Airworthiness Management Organization) of Part-145 maintenance organization with appropriate approval. ARC review process: (1) Verify all Airworthiness Directives (AD's) complied within specified intervals. (2) Confirm maintenance program accomplished per EASA Part-M requirements (inspections, component overhauls, life-limited parts tracking). (3) Review aircraft technical log accuracy en completeness. (4) Physical aircraft inspection verify condition matches documentation, check for corrosion/damage/modifications. (5) Verify insurance, registration, radio license currency. ARC geldig 1 jaar from issuance, renewal required before expiry voor legal operations. Cost ARC review/renewal: Light jets €5.000-€10.000, midsize jets €8.000-€15.000, heavy jets €12.000-€25.000 depending findings en extra werk required. ARC expiry serious: operations illegal zonder geldig ARC, insurance kunnen invalidate, re-issuance requires full annual inspection plus accumulated maintenance since expiry. Management companies typically track ARC expiry 3 maanden vooraf en schedule renewal inspections proactively. Part-NCC private operations kunnen simplified ARC process vs Part-135 commercial (minder frequent physical inspections toegestaan indien maintenance history excellent)."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Wat zijn EASA Airworthiness Directives?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Airworthiness Directives (AD's, luchtwaardigheidsvoorschriften) zijn mandatory veiligheidsmodificaties/inspections issued door EASA voor gecertificeerde aircraft types wanneer unsafe conditions discovered. AD's triggered door: in-service failures/incidents (engine component cracks, landing gear collapses), accident investigations revealing design flaws, manufacturer service bulletins upgraded mandatory status, aging aircraft issues (corrosion, fatigue cracks). EASA AD compliance mandatory - niet optional zoals manufacturer Service Bulletins. Non-compliance grounds aircraft legally, violatie ILT enforcement actions (fines, registration suspension). AD categories: (1) Emergency AD's - immediate compliance before next flight (rare maar critical safety). (2) Time-limited AD's - comply binnen specified flight hours/calendar days (bijv. inspect within 50 hours or 30 days). (3) Recurring AD's - repetitive inspections/actions at intervals (bijv. inspect every 500 hours). (4) One-time AD's - single modification/inspection. EASA vs FAA AD's verschillen: EASA AD's applicable alle EU-registered aircraft, FAA AD's alleen N-registered. Import USA aircraft naar PH-registry requires verify alle applicable EASA AD's accomplished - vaak FAA AD compliance insufficient, extra werk needed €5.000-€50.000 depending aircraft type/age. AD compliance tracking via CAMO - they monitor new AD issuance, schedule compliance, document accomplishment. Cost varies wildly: simple inspection AD's €500-€2.000, major modifications €10.000-€100.000+ (bijv. engine component replacement). Ongoing AD compliance part jaarlijkse maintenance budget - budget €5.000-€20.000 annually average bizjet accounting new AD's issued."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Wat is Part-M Continuing Airworthiness Management?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"EASA Part-M regulation governs continuing airworthiness management ensuring aircraft maintains luchtwaardigheid throughout operational life. Part-M compliance mandatory alle PH-registered aircraft. Key components: (1) CAMO (Continuing Airworthiness Management Organization) - EASA-approved entity responsible airworthiness management, maintenance program development, AD compliance tracking, ARC issuance. Owner must contract CAMO (usually aircraft management company with Part-M approval). (2) Maintenance Program - tailored plan defining inspection intervals, maintenance tasks, component overhaul schedules based aircraft type, usage, manufacturer recommendations. Must EASA-approved before use. (3) Technical Log - continuous record all flights, maintenance performed, defects discovered/rectified, AD compliance. Legal document required onboard aircraft. (4) Maintenance Planning - CAMO schedules inspections/overhauls optimizing aircraft availability while ensuring compliance. Coordinates Part-145 approved maintenance facilities. (5) Airworthiness Review - annual ARC renewal via comprehensive review maintenance compliance. Part-M subparts: (A) technical requirements (all aircraft), (B) CAMO requirements (approval standards), (C) alternative lighter requirements ELA1 aircraft (small piston singles). Cost Part-M CAMO services: Light jets €8.000-€15.000 annually, midsize jets €12.000-€25.000, heavy jets €20.000-€40.000. Includes maintenance program management, AD tracking, ARC coordination, technical log review, ILT liaison. Violation Part-M requirements serious: ARC non-renewal, ILT findings requiring corrective action, possible registration suspension repeat offenses. Professional CAMO essential complexity EASA airworthiness management - attempting owner self-management legal (Part-M Subpart G) maar extremely complex en time-consuming, not recommended business jets."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Welke crew licensing vereisten gelden?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"EASA crew licensing (pilot, cabin crew) vereist voor PH-registered aircraft operations: Pilot licenses: (1) EASA Part-FCL license - EU harmonized pilot licensing replacing oude nationale JAA licenses. Categories: PPL (Private Pilot License), CPL (Commercial), ATPL (Airline Transport). (2) Type rating - specific aircraft type training/checkride required jets (bijv. CE-525 Citation, G-IV Gulfstream). Valid 1 jaar, renewal via proficiency check. (3) Medical certificate - Class 1 (commercial operations), Class 2 (private). Validity 6-12 maanden depending age. (4) Instrument rating - IR(A) required IFR operations, renewed annually. (5) Language proficiency - ICAO English Level 4 minimum, Level 6 no retest required. Foreign license conversion: FAA licenses kunnen converted EASA via: (1) License validation - temporary 1-year recognition FAA license voor PH-registered aircraft (limited situations). (2) Full conversion - FAA ATPL converts EASA ATPL meeting requirements (EASA exams, hour minimums, checkride). Cost €5.000-€15.000 plus training. Nederlandse specifics: ILT issues EASA licenses domestically. Dutch training organizations JAA/EASA approved. English widely spoken Dutch aviation industry easing foreign pilot employment. Crew employment: Part-NCC private operations flexible crew sourcing (owner can hire FAA pilots with validation). Part-135 commercial requires Dutch AOC with EASA-licensed crews, more restrictive. Typical crew costs Nederlandse markt: Captain salary €80.000-€150.000 annually, First Officer €50.000-€90.000 depending experience/aircraft type. Plus training costs €10.000-€25.000 annually per pilot (recurrent simulator, type rating renewals). Total 2-pilot crew Nederlands bizjet: €180.000-€300.000 annual fully loaded (salaries, training, medicals, per diems)."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Wat zijn de verschillen tussen Part-NCC en Part-135?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"EASA Part-NCC (Non-Commercial Complex Motor-Powered Aircraft) vs Part-135 (commercial air transport) fundamental operationele difference: Part-NCC (private operations): Scope: Private/corporate aircraft niet available public charter. Owner flies eigen aircraft, guests/employees only (geen paying passengers). Requirements: (1) Declaration to authority (ILT Nederland), niet full AOC. (2) Simplified operations manual. (3) Accountable manager appointed (can be owner/management company). (4) Maintenance per Part-M continuing airworthiness. (5) Crew qualifications: type-rated, medical valid, no minimum hour requirements beyond type rating. (6) Insurance minimums (EU Regulation 785/2004). Advantages: Lower compliance burden, faster setup (weeks vs months), minimal ongoing audits (risk-based ILT surveillance), operational flexibility. Cost: €5.000-€15.000 setup, €10.000-€25.000 annual compliance via management company. Part-135 (commercial charter): Scope: Aircraft available charter to public, passengers pay for flights. Requires full AOC. Requirements: (1) Air Operator Certificate (AOC) issued ILT after extensive application/audit process. (2) Comprehensive operations specifications defining authorized operations. (3) Full operations manual, safety management system, quality assurance program. (4) Key personnel: Accountable Manager, Operations Manager, Safety Manager, Maintenance Manager - all ILT-approved. (5) Crew minimums: higher hour requirements, recurrent training 6-monthly simulators. (6) Operational control, flight following, dispatch procedures. Setup timeline: 6-12 months AOC issuance. Cost: €50.000-€150.000 setup, €100.000-€300.000 annual compliance overhead. When choose: Part-NCC sufficient pure private/corporate use, significant cost savings. Part-135 required charter revenue or fractional ownership operations. Some owners structured Part-NCC primary use with occasional charter via third-party AOC operator (management company's certificate) offsetting costs while maintaining operational simplicity."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Hoe werken operations specifications?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Operations Specifications (Ops Specs) zijn detailed authorizations issued door ILT defining exact scope permissible operations voor AOC holders (Part-135 commercial operators). Ops Specs specify: (1) Authorized aircraft - specific registrations/types operator may use (bijv. PH-ABC Citation XLS+, PH-DEF Challenger 350). (2) Geographic limitations - authorized operational areas (EU only, worldwide, specific countries excluded). (3) Airports approved - lista approved departure/arrival airports meeting operator's standards/training. (4) Operations types - VFR/IFR, day/night, single-pilot/multi-crew, RVSM airspace, Cat II/III approaches. (5) Crew composition - minimum crew for aircraft type, PIC minimums (hours/qualifications). (6) Maintenance - approved maintenance organizations, maintenance control procedures. (7) Special authorizations - dangerous goods, EMS operations, extended over-water (ETOPS-equivalent bizjets). Ops Specs niet static - amendments required adding aircraft/airports/capabilities. Amendment process: operator requests via formal application, ILT reviews (2-6 weken), approval issued or denied. Cost amendments €1.000-€5.000 depending complexity. Part-NCC operators geen formal Ops Specs - simplified declaration system. However internal operational limitations established via operations manual (crew minimums, weather minimums, airport requirements) en must followed. Ops Specs violations serious Part-135 operators: ILT findings, corrective action plans required, repeat violations kunnen trigger AOC suspension. Annual ILT audits verify Ops Specs compliance. Cost maintaining AOC + Ops Specs compliance: Dedicated operations/safety staff, SMS implementation, training programs, quality assurance audits. Small single-aircraft operator: €100.000-€200.000 annual overhead. Multi-aircraft fleet: €300.000-€1M+ depending size/complexity. Why relevant buyers: Understanding Ops Specs helps evaluate charter operators (more authorized airports/capabilities = better), and informs own decisions re: Part-NCC private vs Part-135 commercial structuring."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Wat zijn de Nederland-specifieke EASA implementaties?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Nederlandse ILT EASA implementation specifics: (1) Registration requirements - ILT requires Nederlandse legal entity (BV/NV) of EU resident for PH-registration, stricter than some EU states allowing offshore structures easier. (2) Part-NCC streamlined - ILT generally reasonable Part-NCC approvals, simplified process private operators, risk-based surveillance approach minimizing burden compliant operators. (3) AOC issuance - ILT thorough AOC application reviews (6-12 months typical), comprehensive document audits, maar predictable/professional process (niet arbitrary). (4) Language flexibility - ILT accepts English documentation/communications readily (unlike some EU authorities preferring national language), easing international operations. (5) Audit frequency - Part-135 operators expect ILT audit annually minimum, Part-NCC operators risk-based (every 3-5 years unless issues/incidents). (6) Noise/environmental - Schiphol particularly strict noise compliance, ILT enforces environmental requirements closely Nederlandse airports. (7) Penalties proportionate - ILT fines/enforcement generally reasonable compared some EU jurisdictions, focus corrective action over punitive measures unless willful/repeated violations. (8) Foreign operator acceptance - ILT liberal recognizing foreign AOC's operating into Nederland (Third Country Operator approvals routine), facilitating international bizjet traffic. Comparison EU peers: ILT less bureaucratic than French DGAC (notorious paperwork), more thorough than UK CAA historically (though CAA tightened post-Brexit), similar German LBA professionalism. Processing times average EU standards. Cost doing business Nederland higher (hangar, fuel, labor) maar regulatory environment stable/predictable offset. Brexit implications: UK CAA no longer EASA - G-registered aircraft lost automatic EU access, driving some UK operators naar Irish/Maltese registries. PH-registry benefited attracting owners seeking EU operational base. Nederlandse operators generally positive ILT relations - professional, accessible, safety-focused maar pragmatic."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Wat zijn de kosten van EASA compliance?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"EASA compliance cost breakdown Nederlandse context: Initial compliance (nieuwe PH-registered aircraft): Part-M CAMO setup €3.000-€8.000 (maintenance program development, initial records review, EASA systems setup). ARC issuance €5.000-€15.000 (initial airworthiness review, physical inspection, documentation). Part-NCC authorization €3.000-€10.000 (operations manual, declaration filing, accountable manager appointment). Crew licensing €2.000-€5.000 per pilot (medicals, EASA license validation/conversion if foreign). Total initial compliance: Light jet €15.000-€40.000, midsize €25.000-€60.000, heavy jet €40.000-€100.000. Annual recurring compliance: CAMO services €10.000-€40.000 (maintenance program management, AD tracking, technical log review, ILT coordination). ARC renewal €5.000-€25.000 (annual airworthiness review, inspection, certificate issuance). Crew training €10.000-€25.000 per pilot (annual recurrent simulator, type rating renewal, CRM). Crew medicals €1.000-€2.000 per pilot (Class 1 medical exams). Part-NCC administration €3.000-€8.000 (operations manual updates, crew qualification tracking, insurance coordination). Total annual compliance overhead: €30.000-€100.000 typical business jet depending size. Part-135 commercial significantly higher: AOC initial €50.000-€150.000, annual compliance €150.000-€500.000 (operations staff, SMS, training programs, audits). AD compliance variable: Budget €5.000-€20.000 annually new AD's. Occasional major AD's kunnen spike €50.000-€200.000 (engine modifications, structural inspections). Hidden costs EASA vs FAA: EASA Part-145 maintenance facilities sometimes pricier than FAA repair stations (labor rates, certification overhead). European avgas/jet fuel 20-40% costlier than USA. However operational flexibility EU offsetting via reduced permits/paperwork intra-European flights. Optimization: Engage reputable aircraft management company bundling compliance services - their negotiated rates suppliers plus efficiency handling multiple aircraft reduces per-aircraft costs. Typical all-in management fee including EASA compliance: €80.000-€200.000 annually midsize jet."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Hoe zit het met EASA vs FAA luchtwaardigheid?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"EASA vs FAA airworthiness comparison: Certification philosophy: EASA generally prescriptive (specific requirements defined), FAA more performance-based (outcomes defined, methods flexible). Practically: EASA sometimes perceived bureaucratic, FAA pragmatic, maar both rigorous safety. Type certification: EASA CS-23 (light aircraft), CS-25 (transport category jets) vs FAA Part 23/25. Mutual recognition: FAA-certified aircraft accepted EASA with validation (usually straightforward), vice versa. Airworthiness Directives: EASA AD's independent FAA AD's - same underlying issues maar different compliance methods/intervals. Import aircraft requires verify both authority AD's if applicable. EASA AD's sometimes stricter (shorter compliance times, broader applicability). Maintenance standards: EASA Part-145 approved maintenance organizations vs FAA repair stations. EASA Part-145 approval process lengthier/costlier than FAA, resulting fewer facilities globally (especially outside EU) - can complicate maintenance scheduling exotic locations. Part-M continuing airworthiness more structured than FAA Part 91 owner maintenance - CAMO requirement adds oversight layer absent USA (owner with A&P can self-maintain N-registered aircraft, impossible PH-registered). Inspection intervals: Similar - EASA ARC annual review comparable FAA annual inspection. EASA technically 12-month calendar vs FAA can extend slightly, minor practical difference. Cost implications: EASA compliance typically 10-20% more expensive than FAA equivalent due: (1) Fewer approved facilities (less competition), (2) Higher European labor costs, (3) More bureaucratic paperwork (CAMO overhead). (4) Stricter interpretation certain requirements. Operational acceptance: Both EASA/FAA certificates universally accepted worldwide - no significant disadvantage either registry international operations. ICAO standards underpin both. Conversion: Import N-registered to PH requires EASA C of A issuance, ARC establishment, EASA AD compliance - cost €10.000-€50.000 depending aircraft complexity/age. Vice versa PH to N requires FAA review but generally smoother (FAA less bureaucratic intake). Best choice: USA-based operations/owners favor FAA simplicity/cost. Europe-based favor EASA operational convenience EU. Pure compliance stringency roughly equivalent - both prioritize safety adequately."}}]}</script>

            <h2>Inleiding EASA Regelgeving</h2>
            <p>EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency) is de Europese luchtvaart veiligheidsautoriteit die uniform aviation safety standards handhaaft across 31 EU en EFTA landen. Voor Nederlandse PH-geregistreerde vliegtuigen betekent EASA compliance niet alleen een wettelijke verplichting, maar ook operationele voordelen: automatisch vrij verkeer binnen Europa, harmonized luchtwaardigheidsstandaarden, en mutual recognition van crew licenties.</p>
            <p>EASA regelgeving is comprehensive en dekt aircraft certification (type design approval), airworthiness management (ongoing luchtwaardigheid via Part-M), operator authorizations (Part-NCC private, Part-135 commercial), crew licensing (Part-FCL pilot standards), en maintenance organizations (Part-145 facilities). Nederlandse ILT (Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport) implementeert EASA regulations domestically en fungeert als national aviation authority.</p>
            <p>Compliance kosten zijn substantieel maar voorspelbaar: initiële setup €15.000-€100.000 afhankelijk van aircraft size en operational complexity, jaarlijkse recurring costs €30.000-€100.000 voor typische business jet private operations. Commercial Part-135 charter operations significant duurder: AOC setup €50.000-€150.000, annual overhead €150.000-€500.000. Deze kosten dekken CAMO services, ARC renewals, crew training, audits, en administrative compliance.</p>
            <p>Deze gids behandelt fundamentele EASA vereisten: Certificate of Airworthiness, Airworthiness Review Certificates (ARC), Airworthiness Directives compliance, Part-M continuing airworthiness management, crew licensing standards, Part-NCC vs Part-135 operational requirements, operations specifications, Nederlandse ILT specifics, compliance kosten, en EASA vs FAA vergelijking. Begrip van deze framework essentieel voor succesvolle aircraft ownership in Nederland - non-compliance resulteert in grounded aircraft, insurance invalidation, en potentiële legal liability.</p>

            <h2>Certificate of Airworthiness & ARC</h2>
            <p><strong>Certificate of Airworthiness (C of A):</strong></p>
            <p>Het C of A is het fundamentele document dat bevestigt dat een aircraft type gecertificeerd is conform EASA design standards, en dat het individuele exemplaar gebouwd is volgens approved specifications. Issued eenmalig bij manufacture door de type certificate holder authority (EASA voor Europese types, FAA met EASA validation voor Amerikaanse jets). Het certificaat bevestigt dat aircraft voldoet aan EASA Certification Specifications: CS-23 voor light aircraft, CS-25 voor transport category jets.</p>
            <p>Bij import van een buitenlands geregistreerd vliegtuig naar PH-registratie is een nieuw EASA C of A vereist. FAA-certified aircraft bijvoorbeeld krijgt EASA C of A issuance na documentatie review, verification van type certificate validation (meeste Amerikaanse bizjets hebben EASA validation), en soms physical inspection. Kosten nieuwe C of A: €2.000-€10.000 depending complexity. Het C of A blijft permanent geldig zolang aircraft maintained volgens approved standards - dit wordt aangetoond via de Airworthiness Review Certificate.</p>
            <p><strong>Airworthiness Review Certificate (ARC):</strong></p>
            <p>De ARC (EASA Form 15c) demonstreert dat aircraft ongoing luchtwaardigheid behoudt door compliance met maintenance requirements, Airworthiness Directives, en technical standards. Unlike het permanente C of A, vereist ARC annual renewal. Issued door EASA Part-M approved CAMO of Part-145 maintenance organization met appropriate approval scope.</p>
            <p>Het ARC review process omvat: verification alle Airworthiness Directives complied, confirm maintenance program accomplished (inspections, overhauls, life-limited parts tracking), review technical log accuracy, physical aircraft inspection voor corrosion/damage/unauthorized modifications, en verify insurance/registration currency. ARC geldig 1 jaar from issuance, renewal required before expiry voor legal operations. Cost ARC renewal: light jets €5.000-€10.000, midsize €8.000-€15.000, heavy jets €12.000-€25.000 annually.</p>
            <p>ARC expiry is serious: vliegtuig mag niet legaal opereren zonder geldig ARC, verzekeringen kunnen coverage invalidate, en re-issuance requires full annual inspection plus alle accumulated maintenance sinds expiry accomplished. Aircraft management companies typisch track ARC expiry 3 maanden vooraf en schedule renewal inspections proactively, preventing operational disruptions. Part-NCC operators kunnen benefit simplified ARC process (minder frequent physical inspections) indien excellent maintenance history demonstrated.</p>

            <h2>EASA Airworthiness Directives</h2>
            <p>Airworthiness Directives (AD's) zijn mandatory safety modifications of inspections issued door EASA wanneer unsafe conditions discovered in gecertificeerde aircraft types. Triggered door in-service failures, accident investigations revealing design flaws, manufacturer service bulletins upgraded naar mandatory status, of aging aircraft issues zoals corrosion en fatigue cracks. AD compliance is niet optional - het is wettelijk verplicht en non-compliance grounds aircraft.</p>
            <p><strong>AD Categorieën:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emergency AD's:</strong> Immediate compliance before next flight required. Rare maar issued bij critical safety discoveries - bijvoorbeeld structural crack discovered causing in-flight failure risk. Operator moet aircraft ground totdat modification/inspection accomplished.</li>
                <li><strong>Time-limited AD's:</strong> Specify compliance deadline in flight hours of calendar days - bijvoorbeeld "inspect within 50 flight hours or 30 days, whichever occurs first." Meest voorkomende type. Operator plant compliance binnen window without grounding aircraft unnecessarily.</li>
                <li><strong>Recurring AD's:</strong> Require repetitive inspections/actions at specified intervals - bijvoorbeeld "inspect every 500 flight hours for wing spar cracks." Ongoing compliance burden integrated in maintenance planning, costs recurring jaarlijks.</li>
                <li><strong>One-time AD's:</strong> Single modification of inspection - bijvoorbeeld "replace fuel pump P/N xxx with improved P/N yyy." Once accomplished, no further action required that AD.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>EASA vs FAA AD's:</strong> Critical verschil voor aircraft import: EASA AD's applicable alle EU-registered aircraft, FAA AD's alleen N-registered. When importing USA aircraft naar PH-registry, must verify alle applicable EASA AD's accomplished - often FAA AD compliance insufficient. EASA kan eigen AD issued voor same underlying issue met different compliance method/timeline. Gap analysis en remediation kosten €5.000-€50.000 depending aircraft type/age.</p>
            <p>AD compliance tracking via CAMO - they monitor new AD issuance (EASA publishes continuously), determine applicability uw aircraft, schedule compliance coordinating maintenance facilities, en document accomplishment in aircraft records. Cost varies wildly: simple inspection AD's €500-€2.000 labor, major modifications €10.000-€100.000+ (engine component replacements, structural reinforcements). Budget €5.000-€20.000 annually average bizjet accounting new AD's issued. Occasionele "gotcha" AD's kunnen spike €50.000-€200.000 - part ownership risk.</p>

            <p>EASA Part-M regulation governs continuing airworthiness management ensuring aircraft maintains luchtwaardigheid throughout operational life. Part-M compliance mandatory alle PH-registered aircraft - geen exceptions. Owner must contract EASA Part-M approved CAMO (Continuing Airworthiness Management Organization), usually aircraft management company holding Part-M approval.</p>
            <p>CAMO verantwoordelijkheden comprehensive: develop/maintain aircraft-specific maintenance program approved door authority, track/schedule AD compliance ensuring timely accomplishment, coordinate maintenance planning met Part-145 approved facilities, maintain technical records (logbooks, AD status, modifications), perform annual airworthiness reviews issuing ARC, en serve as ILT liaison point for airworthiness matters. This relieves owner of direct compliance burden maar vereist professional organization met EASA expertise.</p>
            <p>Part-M subparts: (A) technical requirements applicable all aircraft, (B) CAMO approval standards en responsibilities, (C) alternative lighter requirements ELA1 aircraft (small piston singles <1.200kg). Business jets fall under Subpart A/B requiring full CAMO. Owner self-management technically mogelijk under Part-M Subpart G (private owner with maintenance knowledge) maar extremely complex business jets - professional CAMO strongly recommended, essentially mandatory practical standpoint.</p>
            <p>Violation Part-M requirements serious consequences: ARC non-renewal grounding aircraft, ILT findings requiring formal corrective action plans, possible registration suspension repeat offenses. Insurance companies kunnen deny claims non-compliance. Professional CAMO essential navigating EASA airworthiness complexity - their annual fees €8.000-€40.000 seem expensive maar prevent far costlier compliance failures, maintenance errors, en operational disruptions.</p>

            <h2>Part-NCC vs Part-135 Operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Part-NCC (Non-Commercial Complex Operations):</strong></p>
            <p>Part-NCC governs private/corporate aircraft operations waar aircraft niet available public charter. Owner flies eigen aircraft transporting guests, employees, business associates - geen paying passengers commercial basis. Part-NCC vereisten streamlined compared commercial: declaration to ILT (niet full AOC application), simplified operations manual, accountable manager appointed (kan owner or management company), maintenance per Part-M, crew type-rated en medically qualified maar geen minimum hour requirements beyond type rating, insurance minimums per EU Regulation 785/2004.</p>
            <p>Setup relatively straightforward: management company prepares operations manual template (aircraft limitations, crew minimums, weather minimums), appoints accountable manager, submits declaration ILT. Processing 2-4 weken typical. Cost: €5.000-€15.000 setup, €10.000-€25.000 annual compliance via management company (operations manual updates, crew qualification tracking, insurance coordination, ILT correspondence). Ongoing ILT surveillance risk-based - compliant operators audited every 3-5 years unless incidents trigger inspection.</p>
            <p><strong>Part-135 (Commercial Air Transport):</strong></p>
            <p>Part-135 governs commercial charter operations waar aircraft available public, passengers pay for flights. Requires full Air Operator Certificate (AOC) issued ILT after extensive application/audit. Requirements significantly more stringent: comprehensive operations manual (hundreds pages), safety management system (SMS), quality assurance program, key personnel ILT-approved (Accountable Manager, Operations Manager, Safety Manager, Maintenance Manager - all Dutch resident), crew minimum hour requirements, recurrent training 6-monthly simulator sessions, operational control/flight following/dispatch procedures, ops specs defining authorized operations.</p>
            <p>AOC setup timeline 6-12 months: pre-application meeting ILT, operations manual development, personnel appointments/training, documentation audit, demonstration flights, final certification inspection. Cost: €50.000-€150.000 professional fees (consultants, manuals, training). Annual compliance overhead: dedicated operations/safety staff salaries, SMS implementation, training programs, quality audits, ILT audit responses. Small single-aircraft operator €100.000-€200.000 annual overhead, multi-aircraft fleets €300.000-€1M+ depending size.</p>
            <p><strong>Wanneer Part-NCC vs Part-135?</strong> Part-NCC sufficient pure private/corporate use - significant cost savings en operational simplicity. Choose Part-135 if: (1) Charter revenue desired offsetting aircraft costs, (2) Fractional ownership program planned, (3) Business model requires public availability. Hybrid approach: owner operates Part-NCC primary use, occasional charter via third-party AOC operator (management company's certificate renting aircraft) - generates revenue without AOC burden, though complicated tax/insurance structuring.</p>

Aircraft zonder geldig C of A mag niet legal opereren.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Hoe werkt de Airworthiness Review Certificate (ARC)?</div><div class="faq-answer">ARC (EASA Form 15c) demonstreert ongoing luchtwaardigheid via annual review. Issued door Part-M approved CAMO of Part-145 organization. Review includes: verify AD compliance, confirm maintenance program accomplished, review technical log, physical aircraft inspection, verify insurance/registration currency. ARC geldig 1 jaar, renewal required before expiry. Cost: Light jets €5.000-€10.000, midsize €8.000-€15.000, heavy €12.000-€25.000. ARC expiry serious: operations illegal, insurance invalid, re-issuance requires full inspection plus accumulated maintenance. Management companies track expiry proactively.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Wat zijn EASA Airworthiness Directives?</div><div class="faq-answer">Airworthiness Directives (AD's) zijn mandatory safety modifications/inspections issued door EASA voor unsafe conditions. Categories: Emergency (immediate compliance), Time-limited (comply within deadline), Recurring (repetitive intervals), One-time (single action). EASA AD's applicable EU-registered aircraft, FAA AD's alleen N-registered. Import USA aircraft requires verify EASA AD's accomplished - FAA compliance often insufficient. Cost varies: simple inspections €500-€2.000, major modifications €10.000-€100.000+. Budget €5.000-€20.000 annually new AD's. CAMO tracks AD issuance and schedules compliance.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Wat is Part-M Continuing Airworthiness Management?</div><div class="faq-answer">EASA Part-M governs continuing airworthiness ensuring aircraft maintains luchtwaardigheid throughout life. Components: CAMO (approved entity managing airworthiness), maintenance program (tailored inspection/overhaul plan), technical log (continuous record), maintenance planning (scheduling), airworthiness review (annual ARC). Owner must contract CAMO. Cost: Light jets €8K-€15K annually, midsize €12K-€25K, heavy €20K-€40K. Includes maintenance program management, AD tracking, ARC coordination. Violation serious: ARC non-renewal, ILT findings, registration suspension. Professional CAMO essential complexity.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Welke crew licensing vereisten gelden?</div><div class="faq-answer">EASA crew licensing requirements: EASA Part-FCL license (PPL/CPL/ATPL), type rating (specific aircraft, valid 1 year), medical certificate (Class 1 commercial, Class 2 private, 6-12 months validity), instrument rating (IR(A) for IFR, renewed annually), language proficiency (ICAO English Level 4 minimum). FAA licenses convert EASA via validation (temporary 1-year) or full conversion (exams, hours, checkride, cost €5K-€15K). Crew costs Nederlands: Captain €80K-€150K annually, First Officer €50K-€90K, plus training €10K-€25K per pilot. Total 2-pilot crew €180K-€300K annual fully loaded.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Wat zijn de verschillen tussen Part-NCC en Part-135?</div><div class="faq-answer">Part-NCC (private operations): Scope owner flies eigen aircraft, geen paying passengers. Requirements: declaration (niet AOC), simplified manual, accountable manager, Part-M maintenance, type-rated crew. Advantages: lower burden, faster setup (weeks), minimal audits. Cost: €5K-€15K setup, €10K-€25K annual. Part-135 (commercial charter): Scope public charter, paying passengers. Requirements: full AOC, ops specs, comprehensive manuals, SMS, key personnel approved, crew minimums, training programs. Timeline: 6-12 months setup. Cost: €50K-€150K setup, €150K-€500K annual overhead. Choose Part-NCC private use cost savings, Part-135 charter revenue desired.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Hoe werken operations specifications?</div><div class="faq-answer">Operations Specifications (Ops Specs) zijn detailed authorizations ILT defining scope permissible operations Part-135 AOC holders. Specify: authorized aircraft (registrations/types), geographic limitations, approved airports, operations types (VFR/IFR, day/night, RVSM, Cat II/III), crew composition minimums, maintenance procedures, special authorizations (dangerous goods, ETOPS). Amendments required adding aircraft/airports, processing 2-6 weken, cost €1K-€5K. Part-NCC operators geen formal Ops Specs - simplified declaration. Violations serious: ILT findings, AOC suspension possible. Cost maintaining compliance: €100K-€200K annual overhead small operator, €300K-€1M+ fleets.</div></div>
            <div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-question">Wat zijn de Nederland-specifieke EASA implementaties?</div><div class="faq-answer">Nederlandse ILT EASA specifics: Registration requires Nederlandse BV/EU resident (stricter than some states). Part-NCC streamlined approvals, risk-based surveillance. AOC thorough reviews 6-12 months maar predictable. Language flexibility - English accepted readily. Audit frequency: Part-135 annually, Part-NCC every 3-5 years risk-based. Noise/environmental strict Schiphol. Penalties proportionate, focus corrective action. Foreign operator acceptance liberal. Comparison: Less bureaucratic than French DGAC, more thorough than UK CAA historically, similar German LBA professionalism. Processing times average EU.
