# Roadmap: JetSelect - Private Jet Lead Generation

## Overview

Transform the existing functional wizard into a premium, converting luxury experience. The journey focuses on UI/UX polish that matches the sophistication of multi-million euro private jet purchases—smooth animations, refined aesthetics, mobile-first perfection, and performance optimization. Backend integration deferred to future milestones.

## Domain Expertise

None - Frontend polish project using established web UI patterns

## Phases

- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundation & Animation Framework** - Set up Framer Motion and core animation infrastructure
- [ ] **Phase 2: Wizard Flow Polish** - Smooth step transitions, progress indicators, and micro-interactions
- [ ] **Phase 3: Premium Visual Design** - High-end imagery, typography refinement, luxury aesthetics
- [ ] **Phase 4: Mobile-First Optimization** - Perfect responsive experience across all devices
- [ ] **Phase 5: Interactive Elements** - Card hover states, form validation, success animations
- [ ] **Phase 6: Performance & Polish** - Scroll effects, parallax, final optimization pass

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation & Animation Framework
**Goal**: Establish animation infrastructure for smooth, professional interactions throughout the site
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Research**: Likely (new library integration into vanilla JS)
**Research topics**: Framer Motion integration patterns for vanilla JS projects, luxury brand animation standards and timing curves, performance considerations for animation-heavy sites
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during phase planning

### Phase 2: Wizard Flow Polish
**Goal**: Create buttery-smooth wizard experience with polished transitions and progress feedback
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Research**: Unlikely (working with existing wizard structure using internal patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during phase planning

### Phase 3: Premium Visual Design
**Goal**: Elevate visual aesthetics to luxury brand standards with refined imagery and typography
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Research**: Unlikely (design refinement using established brand guidelines)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during phase planning

### Phase 4: Mobile-First Optimization
**Goal**: Deliver pixel-perfect responsive experience across all premium devices
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Research**: Unlikely (standard responsive patterns with existing breakpoints)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during phase planning

### Phase 5: Interactive Elements
**Goal**: Implement delightful micro-interactions for cards, forms, and user feedback
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Research**: Unlikely (standard UI patterns for interactive elements)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during phase planning

### Phase 6: Performance & Polish
**Goal**: Add premium scroll effects and optimize for blazing-fast load times
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Research**: Likely (scroll effects and parallax require performance optimization)
**Research topics**: Smooth scroll libraries compatible with vanilla JS, parallax implementation patterns, performance optimization techniques for animation-heavy sites
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during phase planning
