## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

**Phase 7 Tool Selection (2026-02-07):**
- SerpBear for rank tracking (self-hosted, Google.nl support)
- python-seo-analyzer for competitor analysis (open source, no API cost)
- Lighthouse for technical SEO baseline (industry standard)
- ScrapingRobot API for SERP scraping (free tier sufficient)
- Markdown templates for data collection (version control, portability)

**Phase 7 Research Method (2026-02-07):**
- Automated competitive intelligence via WebSearch tool (13min execution vs 2+ hour manual estimate)
- Featured snippet vacuum identified - NO competitor owns snippets for primary keywords
- Business aircraft segment prioritized separately with tax/ROI focus

**Phase 7 Content Strategy (2026-02-07):**
- 100+ page sitemap architecture: 5 pillar pages, 15 cluster pages, 30+ supporting pages
- Competitive differentiation: 10x content depth + 5 interactive tools + Netherlands specialization + B2B focus
- Quick wins prioritization: Rent vs buy comparison, business tax guide, operating cost calculator (ZERO competition)
- SERP feature strategy: 11 featured snippets (ZERO current owners), 14 PAA questions
- Interactive tool specifications: Cost calculator, aircraft selector, rent vs buy calculator, ROI calculator, financing calculator

**Phase 8 Content Architecture (2026-02-07):**
- Semantic clustering: 8 topical clusters (Buying Process, Cost & Economics, Financing, Business Aviation, Aircraft Types, Used Market, Netherlands-Specific, Ownership Alternatives) with 67 keywords organized by search intent and business value
- Pillar architecture: 5 flagship pillar pages (Ultimate Buying Guide, Netherlands Guide, Business Aircraft Guide, Cost Guide, Rent vs Buy) with complete content briefs (H2/H3 outlines, interactive tools, SERP targets)
- Sitemap: 111 pages total (5 pillars + 58 clusters + 48 supporting) with bilingual URL structure (Dutch primary, English secondary)
- URL patterns: /kopen/ (buying), /gids/ (guides), /locaties/ (cities), /vliegtuigen/ (aircraft), /zakelijk/ (business), /tools/ (calculators)
- Internal linking topology: Hub-spoke model concentrates authority on pillar pages
- Content volume: 210,500 words planned across Phases 10-13 (26-week production timeline)
- Interactive tools: 10 calculators/selectors specified (operating cost, aircraft selector, ROI, rent vs buy, financing, airport comparison, tax calculator, timeline estimator, quick recommender, break-even)
- B2B segment: Separate business aviation pillar with tax/ROI/financing focus (underserved by competitors)
- Rent vs buy pillar: ZERO-competition opportunity elevated to standalone pillar (converts charter browsers to ownership)

**Phase 9 Schema.org Strategy (2026-02-07):**
- Structured data format: JSON-LD in head over microdata attributes (Google's preferred format, cleaner HTML)
- Schema organization: Separate script blocks per schema type vs. single combined @graph (easier maintenance)
- Template approach: FAQPage schema as commented HTML template for Phase 10 consistency
- Schema scope: Organization + LocalBusiness + BreadcrumbList active; FAQPage template ready; Product/Review/Event schemas deferred to later phases

### Deferred Issues

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Active Blockers:**
- Chrome browser required for automated Lighthouse audits (low priority - manual alternative available)
- ScrapingRobot API key needed for SerpBear rank tracking (free tier, user signup required)

**Impact:** None - Plan 2 complete via automated research. Blockers deferred to later technical SEO phases.

### Roadmap Evolution

- 2026-01-27: Initial roadmap created - v1.0 UI/UX Polish (6 phases)
- 2026-02-07: Milestone v2.0 SEO Domination created - Netherlands #1 strategy (9 phases, 7-15)
