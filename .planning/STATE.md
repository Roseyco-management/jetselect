### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

**Phase 7 Tool Selection (2026-02-07):**
- SerpBear for rank tracking (self-hosted, Google.nl support)
- python-seo-analyzer for competitor analysis (open source, no API cost)
- Lighthouse for technical SEO baseline (industry standard)
- ScrapingRobot API for SERP scraping (free tier sufficient)
- Markdown templates for data collection (version control, portability)

**Phase 7 Research Method (2026-02-07):**
- Automated competitive intelligence via WebSearch tool (13min execution vs 2+ hour manual estimate)
- Featured snippet vacuum identified - NO competitor owns snippets for primary keywords
- Business aircraft segment prioritized separately with tax/ROI focus

**Phase 7 Content Strategy (2026-02-07):**
- 100+ page sitemap architecture: 5 pillar pages, 15 cluster pages, 30+ supporting pages
- Competitive differentiation: 10x content depth + 5 interactive tools + Netherlands specialization + B2B focus
- Quick wins prioritization: Rent vs buy comparison, business tax guide, operating cost calculator (ZERO competition)
- SERP feature strategy: 11 featured snippets (ZERO current owners), 14 PAA questions
- Interactive tool specifications: Cost calculator, aircraft selector, rent vs buy calculator, ROI calculator, financing calculator

### Deferred Issues

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Active Blockers:**
- Chrome browser required for automated Lighthouse audits (low priority - manual alternative available)
- ScrapingRobot API key needed for SerpBear rank tracking (free tier, user signup required)

**Impact:** None - Plan 2 complete via automated research. Blockers deferred to later technical SEO phases.
