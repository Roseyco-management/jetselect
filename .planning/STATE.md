Recent decisions affecting current work:

**Phase 7 Tool Selection (2026-02-07):**

- Lighthouse for technical SEO baseline (industry standard)
- ScrapingRobot API for SERP scraping (free tier sufficient)
- Markdown templates for data collection (version control, portability)

**Phase 7 Research Method (2026-02-07):**
- Automated competitive intelligence via WebSearch tool (13min execution vs 2+ hour manual estimate)

- 100+ page sitemap architecture: 5 pillar pages, 15 cluster pages, 30+ supporting pages

### Deferred Issues

None yet.
