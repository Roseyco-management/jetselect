**Tech stack available:**
- Vanilla JS: 52KB current (target: <60KB final)
- CSS: 29KB current (target: <35KB final)
- Images: 2 JPEGs (60KB total, already optimized in Phase 9-04)

**Established patterns:**
- Phase 9-04: Progressive JPEG conversion, jpegtran tool, unused asset removal
- Image optimization: Progressive JPEG for faster perceived loading
- Performance target: 90+ Lighthouse score, <200KB total page weight

**Constraining decisions:**
- Zero-dependency architecture maintained
- No build tooling or minification (keep development-friendly)
- Manual performance assessment (Chrome unavailable per STATE.md blocker)

**Current performance baseline (from Phase 9-04):**
- Page weight reduced from 172KB → 136KB (21% reduction)
- Core Web Vitals targets: LCP <2.0s, FID <50ms, CLS <0.1
- All images already progressive JPEG format

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Asset audit and optimization</name>
  <files>improved/js/script.js, improved/css/style.css, improved/images/</files>
  <action>
Audit all assets and optimize any remaining opportunities.

**JavaScript audit (script.js):**
1. Check for commented-out code blocks and remove (keep essential comments only)
2. Look for duplicate functions or redundant code from previous phases
3. Verify no unused event listeners or dead code paths
4. Check console.log statements - remove debug logs, keep intentional logs (form submissions)
5. Measure final size: `wc -c improved/js/script.js`

**CSS audit (style.css):**
1. Check for unused CSS rules (classes not referenced in HTML)
2. Look for duplicate or redundant styles from phase iterations
3. Verify all CSS custom properties in :root are used
4. Remove any commented-out style blocks
5. Check for vendor prefixes that are no longer needed (2026 = modern browsers only)
6. Measure final size: `wc -c improved/css/style.css`

**Image audit:**
1. List all images: `ls -lh improved/images/`
2. Verify all images are referenced in HTML/CSS (no orphaned files)
3. Check if any images can be further optimized or converted to WebP (if significant savings)
4. Confirm progressive JPEG format: `identify -verbose improved/images/*.jpg | grep Interlace`
5. Total image weight target: <80KB

**HTML audit:**
1. Remove any unused script tags or link tags
2. Verify resource hints are optimal (preconnect for Google Fonts from Phase 9-04)
3. Check for redundant inline styles or scripts

Goal: Maintain functionality while reducing total page weight to <180KB (currently ~140KB with new JS/CSS from Phase 6).

Do NOT minify or obfuscate - keep code readable for development. Production minification is a deployment concern, not development concern.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Run asset size check:
   ```bash
   cd improved
   ls -lh css/style.css js/script.js images/*
   du -ch css js images | tail -1
   ```
2. Verify totals: CSS <35KB, JS <60KB, Images <80KB, Total <180KB
3. Open index.html in browser - everything still works perfectly
4. Check browser console - no errors, only intentional logs
5. Test full wizard flow - all animations and interactions work
  </verify>
  <done>
- All dead code and unused assets removed
- JavaScript under 60KB, CSS under 35KB
- Total page weight under 180KB
- No functionality broken during cleanup
- Code remains readable and maintainable
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Code consolidation and final polish</name>
  <files>improved/js/script.js, improved/css/style.css</files>
  <action>
Consolidate any duplicate patterns and apply final polish across the codebase.

**JavaScript consolidation:**
1. Check AnimationManager methods for any duplicate animation patterns that could be consolidated
2. Verify consistent use of luxury easing (cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)) across all animations
3. Ensure all Motion One calls use consistent duration/easing approach
4. Standardize error handling pattern (currently minimal per CONCERNS.md)
5. Verify all event listeners are properly scoped and don't leak

**CSS consolidation:**
1. Look for duplicate transition definitions - consolidate to CSS custom properties if possible
2. Check for redundant media query breakpoints - ensure consistent breakpoint usage
3. Verify shadow utilities (--shadow-sm/md/lg) are used consistently vs inline definitions
4. Ensure all color references use CSS custom properties (no hardcoded hex codes)
5. Check spacing utilities - consolidate any hardcoded margins/padding to spacing scale

**Animation consistency audit:**
1. Verify all entrance animations use same timing curves
2. Check all hover states use consistent transition durations
3. Ensure stagger delays are consistent (80ms standard from Phase 5)
4. Confirm all animations respect will-change and backface-visibility optimizations

**Code quality polish:**
1. Ensure consistent indentation (4 spaces per CONVENTIONS.md)
2. Verify single quotes for strings (established convention)
3. Check semicolon consistency (required per conventions)
4. Add missing JSDoc comments for complex methods (AnimationManager public methods)

Goal: Final codebase should feel cohesive, with no pattern inconsistencies or technical debt.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Read through AnimationManager class - all methods follow consistent patterns
2. Scan CSS file - no hardcoded colors, all use custom properties
3. Check all animation definitions - consistent easing and timing
4. Test wizard flow completely - all interactions feel cohesive
5. Code review passes "could another developer understand this" test
  </verify>
  <done>
- All duplicate patterns consolidated
- Animation timing and easing 100% consistent
- CSS uses custom properties exclusively (no hardcoded values)
- Code follows established conventions throughout
- Codebase feels polished and production-ready
  </done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete Phase 6 with scroll reveals, parallax, and performance optimization. Site now has premium scroll interactions, 60fps performance, and optimized asset loading.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Performance verification:**
1. Open improved/index.html in browser
2. Open DevTools → Network tab, hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check total page weight: Should be <180KB (DOMContentLoaded)
4. Verify load time: Should feel instant (<1s on broadband)

**Scroll animations verification:**
5. Scroll down slowly through wizard - sections should fade-in-up smoothly
6. Option cards should stagger elegantly (80ms delay) on scroll reveal
7. Hero parallax should create subtle depth (image moves at half-speed)
8. Scrolling should feel buttery smooth at 60fps (no jank or stutter)

**Interaction verification:**
9. Test all card hover states - should still work after scroll animations
10. Test form validation - animated errors should still appear
11. Test success screen - confetti and pulse animations should work
12. Test language switching - all translations should work
13. Test full wizard completion - entire flow should feel polished

**Mobile verification:**
14. Switch to responsive mode (375px width)
15. Scroll through wizard on mobile viewport - animations should work
16. Test touch interactions - all buttons and cards should respond
17. Check for any layout issues or horizontal scroll

**Final quality check:**
18. No console errors or warnings
19. All animations feel premium and coordinated (not competing)
20. Site loads fast and feels luxury throughout
21. Ready to show to high-net-worth users

**Success indicators:**
- ✅ Page weight <180KB
- ✅ Scroll at 60fps (smooth, no jank)
- ✅ All animations work and feel premium
- ✅ Mobile experience is perfect
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Site feels luxury and polished
