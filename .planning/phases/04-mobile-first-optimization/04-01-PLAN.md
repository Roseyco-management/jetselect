**Tech stack available:**
- Motion One v11 (animation framework)
- Vanilla JavaScript (class-based architecture)
- CSS custom properties (design tokens)

**Established patterns:**
- Mobile breakpoints: 768px (tablet), 480px (mobile)
- Animation framework: Motion One with AnimationManager singleton
- Luxury timing curves: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)
- Shadow hierarchy: sm (0.08) → md (0.14) → lg (0.18)
- Typography spacing: luxury letter-spacing ranges

**Constraining decisions:**
- Zero-build vanilla JS architecture (no package.json)
- 60fps animation performance requirement
- Brand colors: teal #115A4E, orange #FA692F
- Fonts: Playfair Display (headings), Poppins (body)

**Current state:**
- Basic responsive layout exists (768px, 480px breakpoints)
- Desktop animations working smoothly (staggered cards, loading spinner)
- Typography and shadows refined for luxury feel
- Hero overlay uses brand teal tint

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Touch-Optimized Interactions</name>
  <files>improved/css/style.css</files>
  <action>
Optimize all interactive elements for touch on mobile devices:

**Tap Targets (minimum 44x44px for iOS/Android accessibility):**
- Progress step circles: Already 32px at 768px - increase to 44px for mobile
- Option cards: Add minimum height 60px on mobile, increase padding for comfortable tapping
- CTA buttons: Ensure minimum 44px height across all buttons
- Language toggle buttons: Increase touch area without visual size change (use padding)
- Form inputs: Increase height to 48px on mobile (currently inherit from desktop)
- Contact form submit button: Ensure 48px minimum height

**Touch-Specific CSS:**
- Remove hover states on touch devices using @media (hover: none) queries
- Add :active states for touch feedback on cards/buttons (subtle scale or opacity)
- Increase spacing between tappable elements to prevent mis-taps (16px minimum)
- Add -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent to remove default tap highlight

**Mobile gesture support:**
- Ensure swipe scrolling works smoothly (no preventDefault on touch events)
- Test that animations don't interfere with native scroll momentum

DO NOT add complex gesture libraries or touch event handlers - keep it simple CSS improvements only.

Manual testing checklist:
1. Open https://localhost or live site on actual mobile device (iPhone/Android)
2. Test all tap targets feel natural (no need to zoom or strain)
3. Verify buttons have 44px+ hit areas
4. Check spacing between tappable elements prevents mis-taps
5. Confirm no sticky hover states on touch devices
6. Test form inputs are easy to tap and type in

Automated checks:
- grep -E "width|height.*44px" improved/css/style.css shows touch-optimized sizes
- grep "@media (hover: none)" improved/css/style.css shows touch-specific styles
  </verify>
  <done>
All interactive elements have 44px+ tap targets on mobile. Touch-specific CSS prevents hover states on touch devices. Spacing between tappable elements is 16px+ to prevent mis-taps. Manual testing on actual mobile device confirms comfortable touch interactions.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Mobile Layout & Spacing Refinements</name>
  <files>improved/css/style.css</files>
  <action>
Refine responsive layouts for premium mobile experience:

**Hero Section Mobile Optimization:**
- Hero height: Desktop 100vh → Tablet 90vh → Mobile 85vh (prevent content below fold on small devices)
- Hero title font-size: Scale down gracefully (desktop 3.5rem → tablet 2.5rem → mobile 2rem)
- Hero subtitle font-size: Desktop 1.25rem → tablet 1.1rem → mobile 1rem
- Hero CTA button: Full-width on mobile (<480px) for easy tapping, maintain inline on tablet

**Wizard Section Mobile Refinements:**
- Step container padding: Reduce from 3rem to 2rem on tablet, 1.5rem on mobile
- Options grid gap: Desktop 1.5rem → tablet 1rem → mobile 0.75rem (tighter but not cramped)
- Progress indicator: Already hidden step labels at 768px - good. Ensure circles are larger (44px)
- Wizard navigation buttons: Full-width stack on mobile (<480px) for clarity

**Typography Mobile Scaling:**
- Section headings (h2): Desktop 2.5rem → tablet 2rem → mobile 1.75rem
- Section subtitles (h3): Desktop 1.5rem → tablet 1.25rem → mobile 1.1rem
- Body text: Maintain 1rem across all devices (readability)
- Option card titles: Desktop 1.25rem → mobile 1.1rem

**Spacing System Mobile:**
- --spacing-xl: Desktop 4rem → tablet 3rem → mobile 2rem
- --spacing-lg: Desktop 3rem → tablet 2rem → mobile 1.5rem
- --spacing-md: Keep 2rem consistent (works well)
- Add mobile-specific spacing utility: --spacing-mobile-safe: 1rem (edges)

**Form Layout Mobile:**
- Contact form grid: Already 1fr on mobile - good
- Form field spacing: Increase gap from 1rem to 1.25rem on mobile for easier scrolling
- Label font-size: Increase from 0.9rem to 1rem on mobile for readability

DO NOT over-compress - luxury brands need breathing room even on mobile.

Manual responsive testing:
1. Test on Chrome DevTools device emulator: iPhone SE (375px), iPhone 14 Pro (430px), iPad (768px)
2. Verify hero doesn't push content below fold on small devices
3. Check typography scales gracefully without cramping
4. Confirm spacing feels luxurious (not cluttered) at all breakpoints
5. Test wizard flow on mobile - easy to read and interact with

Automated checks:
- grep "@media (max-width: 480px)" improved/css/style.css shows mobile refinements
- grep "@media (max-width: 768px)" improved/css/style.css shows tablet adjustments
- Verify font-size scaling logic (2.5rem → 2rem → 1.75rem for h2)
  </verify>
  <done>
Mobile layouts scale gracefully from desktop to tablet to mobile. Hero section optimized for small screens (85vh height prevents content below fold). Typography scales maintain readability and hierarchy. Spacing provides luxury breathing room without cramping. Wizard and forms are easy to use on small devices. Manual testing confirms premium feel across all breakpoints.

  <what-built>Mobile-optimized responsive experience with touch targets, refined layouts, and device-specific polish</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Desktop Testing (1920px+):**
1. Open site in Chrome on desktop: http://localhost:8000 (or live URL)
2. Verify all animations work smoothly (60fps)
3. Check hover states work on option cards and buttons
4. Confirm desktop layout unchanged (hero 100vh, multi-column grids)

**Tablet Testing (768px - 1024px):**
1. Resize browser to 768px width (or use iPad device emulator)
2. Verify hero scales to 90vh
3. Check options grid still has 2 columns (if applicable) or 1 column based on content
4. Test tap targets feel natural (not too small)
5. Confirm typography scales down but remains readable

**Mobile Testing (375px - 480px):**
1. Resize to iPhone SE width (375px) or use device emulator
2. Verify hero is 85vh (content visible below fold)
3. Check all buttons are easy to tap (44px+ targets)
4. Test wizard flow - step through all 7 steps
5. Verify form inputs are easy to tap and type in
6. Check spacing feels luxurious (not cramped)
7. Confirm no horizontal scroll at any point
8. Test language toggle works smoothly

**Real Device Testing (if available):**
1. Open site on actual iPhone or Android phone
2. Test entire wizard flow start to finish
3. Verify animations don't lag or jank
4. Check tap targets feel comfortable
5. Confirm no sticky hover states appear

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Hero scales appropriately across devices (100vh → 90vh → 85vh)
- ✅ All tap targets are easy to hit without zooming
- ✅ Typography remains readable at all sizes
- ✅ Spacing feels premium (not cramped or cluttered)
- ✅ No horizontal scroll at any breakpoint
- ✅ Animations perform smoothly on mobile devices
- ✅ Wizard flow is intuitive and easy to complete on small screens
