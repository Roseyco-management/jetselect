## Decisions Made

**Balanced educational tone:**
- Not pushing ownership as superior option
- Presented genuine pros/cons for both charter and ownership
- Emphasized "right choice depends on your situation"
- Rationale: Builds trust, establishes authority, creates informed buyers who convert better than pressured ones

**Break-even threshold at 100 hours/year:**
- Charter cost-effective under 100 hours
- Ownership advantages emerge 100-150 hours
- Clear ownership benefits above 150 hours
- Rationale: Supported by Netherlands market pricing, aligns with industry consensus, provides clear decision point

**5 usage scenarios covering full spectrum:**
- 25 hours (clear charter territory)
- 50 hours (still charter favorable)
- 100 hours (break-even zone, depends on priorities)
- 150 hours (ownership emerging advantages)
- 200 hours (clear ownership territory)
- Rationale: Readers can self-identify scenario, actionable recommendations, covers casual to frequent users

**Transition path section (Section 11):**
- Created pipeline from charter curiosity to ownership consideration
- Framed ownership as natural evolution, not competitor to charter
- Positioned fractional ownership as middle ground
- Rationale: Converts charter browsers to ownership leads, reduces friction, establishes JetSelect as guide through full journey
