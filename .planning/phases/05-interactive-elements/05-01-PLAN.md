# Key files

**Tech stack available:**
- Motion One v11 animation library (luxury timing curves)
- AnimationManager singleton for centralized control
- Vanilla JS class-based architecture

**Established patterns:**
- cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) as luxury easing
- Staggered animations with 80ms delays
- Progressive enhancement (animations enhance, don't break)
- @media (hover: none) for touch devices

**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 2: Card entrance animations already complete (staggered reveal)
- Phase 4: Touch targets optimized to 44px+ (maintain in hover states)
- Phase 4: @media (hover: none) prevents sticky hovers on touch devices
- All phases: Vanilla JS architecture, no frameworks

**Context:**
- Option cards are the primary interactive element (7 steps × 3 options each)
- Current hover state: ::before gradient shift + subtle scale (already exists)
- Icons already animate on hover/selection (transform + color shift)
- Selected state uses .selected class with stronger ::before gradient

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Enhanced card hover with lift effect and icon pulse</name>
  <files>improved/css/style.css, improved/js/script.js</files>
  <action>
    Enhance .option-card hover states with premium lift effect:

    **CSS changes (style.css):**
    - Increase hover transform: scale(1.02) → scale(1.03) for more dramatic lift
    - Add translateY(-4px) to hover transform for vertical lift effect
    - Enhance shadow on hover: current shadow-md → shadow-lg (12px blur, 0.18 opacity)
    - Smooth transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)
    - Icon hover: Add subtle pulse effect via @keyframes (scale 1→1.05→1 over 1s, once on hover entry)

    **JS changes (script.js):**
    - In handleOptionSelect(), add brief scale pulse when card is clicked (before loading animation)
    - Use Motion One: animate(card, { scale: [1, 1.05, 1] }, { duration: 0.3, easing: 'ease-out' })
    - This provides tactile feedback independent of the loading spinner

    **Avoid:**
    - Don't use continuous pulse loops (distracting)
    - Don't break touch device behavior (@media hover: none must still work)
    - Don't reduce touch target size below 44px minimum

    **Why CSS for hover, JS for click:**
    CSS handles passive hover states (better performance). JS handles active selection feedback (more control over timing).
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. Hover over any option card: should lift up 4px with enhanced shadow
    2. Icon should pulse once on hover entry (subtle scale animation)
    3. Click card: should pulse before loading spinner appears
    4. On mobile/tablet: verify @media (hover: none) removes lift effect
    5. Touch targets still 44px+ minimum
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Desktop hover: Card lifts with translateY(-4px), shadow enhances, icon pulses once
    - Click feedback: Brief scale pulse before loading animation
    - Touch devices: No sticky hover states, touch targets intact
    - Animations smooth with luxury easing curve
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Selection state enhancement with glow effect</name>
  <files>improved/css/style.css</files>
  <action>
    Enhance .option-card.selected state for clearer visual distinction:

    **CSS changes:**
    - Add glowing box-shadow to .selected state: 0 0 0 2px var(--primary), 0 4px 20px rgba(17, 90, 78, 0.3)
    - This creates a subtle teal glow around selected cards
    - Increase ::before gradient opacity on .selected from current to 0.25 (more vibrant)
    - Add transform: scale(1.01) to .selected state (subtle persistent lift)

    **Transition timing:**
    - Glow fades in over 0.4s when selected
    - Scale happens immediately (0.2s) for snappy feedback
    - Use cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) for luxury feel

    **Avoid:**
    - Don't make glow too bright (keep it subtle and premium)
    - Don't break the existing selected state behavior
    - Don't interfere with the card entrance stagger animation from Phase 2
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. Select any option card
    2. Card should show subtle teal glow (2px border + outer shadow)
    3. Card should be slightly larger than siblings (scale 1.01)
    4. Glow fades in smoothly over 0.4s
    5. Deselecting removes glow smoothly
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Selected cards have subtle teal glow effect
    - Selected cards slightly lifted via scale(1.01)
    - Transitions smooth with luxury timing
    - Clear visual distinction between selected and unselected states
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Enhanced card hover states with lift effects, icon pulse animations, and glowing selection states</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: Open improved/index.html in browser (or refresh if already open)
    2. Test desktop hover (width > 1024px):
       - Hover over any option card in Step 1 → should lift up with enhanced shadow
       - Icon should pulse once when you hover over it
    3. Test card selection:
       - Click any card → should pulse briefly before loading spinner
       - Selected card should show subtle teal glow and slight scale increase
       - Click different card → previous glow fades out, new one fades in
    4. Test mobile (resize to 480px or use DevTools):
       - Verify no sticky hover states (cards return to normal after tap)
       - Touch targets still comfortable (44px+)
    5. Navigate through all 7 wizard steps:
       - Confirm hover and selection effects work on every step
       - Animations feel smooth and consistent
