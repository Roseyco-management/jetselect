**Tech stack available:**
- Motion One for orchestrated animations
- AnimationManager for luxury timing curves
- Existing success screen (Step 7, currently static)

**Established patterns:**
- Staggered animations with 80ms delays (from Phase 2)
- Luxury easing: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)
- Scale + opacity for entrance effects
- Brand colors: teal #115A4E, orange #FA692F

**Current success screen:**
- Step 7 container with .success-message class
- Green checkmark icon (.success-icon, currently static)
- Thank you heading and confirmation text
- "Terug naar home" button
- No animations currently (just appears instantly)

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Orchestrated success screen entrance animation</name>
  <files>improved/js/script.js, improved/css/style.css</files>
  <action>
    Create premium multi-stage entrance animation for Step 7 success screen:

    **JS changes (script.js):**
    Add animateSuccessScreen() method to JetSelector class:

    **Stage 1 - Icon reveal (0-600ms):**
    - Success icon (.success-icon): Initially scale(0) opacity(0)
    - Animate: scale(0 → 1.2 → 1) with spring easing, opacity(0 → 1)
    - Duration: 600ms
    - Motion One: animate(icon, { scale: [0, 1.2, 1], opacity: [0, 1] }, { duration: 0.6, easing: 'spring(1, 80, 10, 0)' })

    **Stage 2 - Heading entrance (starts 300ms, overlaps icon):**
    - Success heading (h2): Initially translateY(20px) opacity(0)
    - Animate: translateY(20px → 0), opacity(0 → 1)
    - Duration: 500ms with luxury easing
    - Motion One: animate(heading, { y: [20, 0], opacity: [0, 1] }, { duration: 0.5, easing: [0.16, 1, 0.3, 1], delay: 0.3 })

    **Stage 3 - Message text (starts 450ms):**
    - Success message text (p): translateY(20px) opacity(0)
    - Animate same as heading but delayed
    - Delay: 450ms from start

    **Stage 4 - CTA button (starts 600ms):**
    - "Terug naar home" button: scale(0.8) opacity(0)
    - Animate: scale(0.8 → 1), opacity(0 → 1)
    - Delay: 600ms

    **Stage 5 - Subtle confetti (starts 200ms, during icon):**
    - Create 8-12 small colored dots (teal + orange) around icon
    - Animate radially outward with fade: translateY(0 → -50px), opacity(1 → 0), scale(1 → 0.5)
    - Stagger: 30ms between each dot
    - Remove from DOM after animation completes

    **Call animateSuccessScreen():**
    - In handleFormSubmit() after showing Step 7
    - After currentStep = 7 and showStep(7)

    **CSS setup (style.css):**
    - .success-screen-enter class: children initially hidden (opacity: 0, transforms applied)
    - .confetti-dot: position: absolute, width: 8px, height: 8px, border-radius: 50%, pointer-events: none
    - Success icon container: position: relative for confetti positioning

    **Confetti implementation:**
    - Create dots with JS, positioned in circle around icon
    - Use Math.cos/sin for radial positions (360° / dotCount)
    - Alternate teal/orange colors
    - Clean up dots after animation completes (removeChild)

    **Avoid:**
    - Don't make confetti too large or distracting (subtle celebration only)
    - Don't delay total animation beyond 1.5s (users want confirmation, not a show)
    - Don't block user interaction during animation (button should be clickable after appearing)
    - Don't use canvas or WebGL (keep it simple with DOM elements)
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. Fill out form completely and submit
    2. Success screen should animate in stages:
       - Icon scales up with bounce (0-600ms)
       - Confetti dots radiate outward during icon animation
       - Heading slides up and fades in (300-800ms)
       - Message text follows (450-950ms)
       - Button scales in last (600-1100ms)
    3. Total animation completes within ~1.1 seconds
    4. All elements visible and interactive after animation
    5. No layout shift or jank during animation
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Success icon animates with spring bounce
    - Confetti dots radiate outward with fade
    - Text elements slide up with stagger
    - Button scales in smoothly
    - Total animation ~1.1s, feels premium but not slow
    - All animations use Motion One with luxury timing
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add subtle icon pulse on success screen idle state</name>
  <files>improved/css/style.css</files>
  <action>
    After success animation completes, add very subtle continuous pulse to icon:

    **CSS changes (style.css):**
    - Create @keyframes success-pulse: scale(1 → 1.05 → 1)
    - Duration: 2s
    - Iteration: infinite
    - Easing: ease-in-out
    - Apply to .success-icon after entrance animation completes

    **JS changes (script.js):**
    - At end of animateSuccessScreen(), add .pulse class to icon
    - CSS handles the continuous animation via keyframes

    **Pulse specifications:**
    - Very subtle: scale range 1 → 1.05 (not dramatic)
    - Slow: 2-second cycle (not frantic)
    - Smooth: ease-in-out timing
    - Purpose: Keeps screen feeling alive without being distracting

    **Avoid:**
    - Don't make pulse too fast or large (subtle is premium)
    - Don't pulse other elements (icon only)
    - Don't interfere with entrance animation (apply after entrance completes)
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. After success screen entrance animation completes
    2. Success icon should gently pulse (scale 1 → 1.05 → 1)
    3. Pulse continues smoothly and indefinitely
    4. Pulse is subtle and calming, not distracting
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Success icon pulses gently after entrance completes
    - Pulse is subtle (1.05 max scale) and slow (2s cycle)
    - Animation continuous and smooth
    - Doesn't interfere with other interactions
  </done>
</task>

    1. Run: Open improved/index.html in browser
    2. Complete the entire wizard flow:
       - Select options for Steps 1-5
       - Fill out contact form in Step 6 (use valid email)
       - Click submit button
    3. Watch success screen animation:
       - Icon should bounce in with spring effect
       - Confetti dots (teal/orange) should radiate outward
       - Heading should slide up and fade in after icon starts
       - Message text should follow heading
       - Button should scale in last
       - Total animation should feel quick but premium (~1.1s)
    4. After animation completes:
       - Icon should pulse gently every 2 seconds
       - All text readable and button clickable
       - No jank or layout shifts
    5. Test on mobile (resize to 480px):
       - Animation should still work smoothly
       - Confetti positions correctly on smaller screen
       - Text doesn't overflow or break layout
