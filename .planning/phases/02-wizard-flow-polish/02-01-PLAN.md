<objective>
Enhance wizard step transitions with staggered card animations and polished loading states.

Purpose: Create smooth, professional micro-interactions that make the wizard feel responsive and premium.
Output: Wizard cards animate in with stagger effect, loading states provide clear feedback, buttons show interactive states.

**Tech stack available:**
- Motion One v11 (5KB animation library)
- AnimationManager class with methods: fadeIn, fadeOut, slideIn, scaleSelect
- Luxury timing curves: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)
- Durations: fast (300ms), medium (500ms), slow (800ms)

**Established patterns:**
- AnimationManager singleton pattern for centralized control
- Progressive enhancement (animations enhance, don't break)
- 60fps performance maintained

**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 1: Motion One chosen for 5KB footprint, AnimationManager created
- Zero-build architecture (CDN delivery only)

**Current wizard structure:**
- 7 steps total (5 selection steps + form + success)
- .step-container elements with data-step attribute
- .option-card elements in .options-grid
- Current transitions: fadeOut → fadeIn (Phase 1)

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add staggered entrance animations to option cards</name>
  <files>improved/js/script.js</files>
  <action>
Add a new AnimationManager method `staggerIn(cards, options)` that animates an array of elements with sequential delays. Use Motion One's stagger feature or manual delay calculation. Then modify JetSelector.showStep() to call this method on .option-card elements when a step becomes active. Use 80ms delay between cards, fadeIn + slideIn from below (translateY: 20px → 0). Apply luxury easing curve. AVOID animating on every step show - only animate cards on first appearance per step (check if cards already have a data-animated attribute to prevent re-animation on back navigation).
  </action>
  <verify>Navigate forward through wizard steps 1-5. Each step's cards should appear with smooth stagger (not all at once). Going back and forward again should not re-trigger animation.</verify>
  <done>Option cards stagger in sequentially on first view, smooth 80ms delay, no re-animation on revisit.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create loading state spinner animation</name>
  <files>improved/js/script.js</files>
  <action>
Add AnimationManager method `showSpinner(element)` and `hideSpinner(element)` that creates a rotating spinner overlay. Use Motion One's animate() with rotation transform (0deg → 360deg) and infinite loop. Create a small inline SVG circle spinner (20px diameter, 2px stroke) that overlays the element with semi-transparent background. Position absolutely, centered. When showing: fade in overlay + start rotation. When hiding: fade out overlay + stop rotation. Use fast duration (300ms) for fade, continuous rotation at 1s per revolution. Follow existing class pattern (methods on AnimationManager).
  </action>
  <verify>Call window.animationManager.showSpinner(someElement) and hideSpinner() in console. Spinner should fade in/out smoothly, rotate continuously while visible.</verify>
  <done>Spinner methods work, smooth fade in/out, continuous rotation, no performance issues.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add loading animation to Next button on click</name>
  <files>improved/js/script.js</files>
  <action>
Modify JetSelector.handleOptionSelect() to show brief loading state on "Next" step transition. After card selection, before calling this.currentStep++, show spinner on the selected card for 400ms (simulates processing). Use the showSpinner method from Task 2. After 400ms delay, hide spinner and proceed with step transition. This creates perceived responsiveness. AVOID blocking user interaction for too long - 400ms is enough to feel polished without feeling slow. If card already selected (re-click), skip loading state.
  </action>
  <verify>Click option cards - should show brief spinner before transitioning to next step. Re-clicking same card should not show spinner again. Transition feels smooth, not janky.</verify>
  <done>Cards show 400ms loading spinner after selection, smooth transition follows, no jank or blocking.</done>
</task>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] Navigate through all 5 wizard steps - cards stagger in smoothly
- [ ] Click various options - loading spinner appears briefly
- [ ] Navigate back/forward - no duplicate animations
- [ ] Check console for errors - none present
- [ ] Verify 60fps performance maintained (no frame drops)
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- All tasks completed
- Option cards stagger in with 80ms delay on first view
- Loading spinner shows for 400ms after card selection
- No re-animation on back navigation
- 60fps performance maintained
- No errors in console
