<objective>
Polish progress indicator with animated step states and visual feedback.

Purpose: Give users clear, animated feedback about wizard progress and completion states.
Output: Active step pulses subtly, completed steps show checkmark animation, numbers transition smoothly.

**Tech stack available:**
- Motion One v11 with AnimationManager
- Existing progress indicator: .progress-step elements with .active and .completed classes
- Current behavior: updateProgress() adds/removes classes, progress bar animates width

**From Plan 02-01:**
- Staggered card animations
- Loading spinner on card selection
- Enhanced step transition feedback

**Current progress structure:**
- .progress-steps container with 5 .progress-step elements
- Each step has data-step attribute
- Classes: .active (current), .completed (finished)
- Progress bar (#progressFill) animates width

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add pulse animation to active progress step</name>
  <files>improved/js/script.js, improved/css/style.css</files>
  <action>
In JetSelector.updateProgress(), when adding .active class to a step indicator, trigger a subtle pulse animation using Motion One. Animate scale from 1 → 1.1 → 1 over 600ms with luxury easing. In CSS, add a subtle box-shadow animation for the pulse effect (0 0 0 0 → 0 0 0 8px with fade). Use Motion One for scale, CSS transition for shadow (performance optimization - shadows animate better in CSS). Remove pulse animation when step becomes .completed. AVOID continuous looping pulse - single pulse on activation only.
  </action>
  <verify>Navigate through wizard - active step indicator should pulse once when becoming active. Pulse should be subtle, not distracting. No continuous animation.</verify>
  <done>Active step pulses once on activation, scale 1→1.1→1 smoothly, shadow fades nicely, stops when completed.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add checkmark animation to completed steps</name>
  <files>improved/js/script.js, improved/css/style.css</files>
  <action>
Modify updateProgress() to add SVG checkmark to .completed steps. Create inline SVG checkmark (16x16px, white stroke) and animate its stroke-dashoffset for draw-in effect (stroke-dasharray: 20, stroke-dashoffset: 20 → 0). Use Motion One to animate dashoffset over 400ms with luxury easing. Position checkmark absolutely over the step number. When step becomes completed, fade out number (opacity: 1 → 0, 200ms) then animate checkmark in (dashoffset + fadeIn). Use AnimationManager for orchestration. AVOID adding multiple checkmarks - check if checkmark already exists before creating. Follow existing pattern of step number spans.
  </action>
  <verify>Complete steps 1-5 by moving forward. Each completed step should fade out its number and draw in a checkmark smoothly. No duplicate checkmarks, clean animation sequence.</verify>
  <done>Completed steps show animated checkmark, number fades out first, checkmark draws in smoothly, no duplicates.</done>
</task>

  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: Open improved/index.html in browser (or existing dev server)
    2. Start wizard from Step 1
    3. Observe: Active step 1 indicator pulses once (scale + shadow)
    4. Click any option to proceed to Step 2
    5. Observe: Step 1 number fades out, checkmark draws in
    6. Observe: Step 2 indicator pulses once on becoming active
    7. Continue through all 5 steps, verify each transition
    8. Navigate backwards (if back button exists) - verify states update correctly
    9. Check: Animations are smooth, no jank, 60fps maintained
    10. Check: No console errors

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] All 5 progress steps pulse when becoming active
- [ ] Completed steps show checkmark animation
- [ ] Progress bar width animates smoothly (from Phase 1)
- [ ] No duplicate checkmarks or visual glitches
- [ ] 60fps performance maintained
- [ ] No console errors

<success_criteria>

- All tasks completed
- Active step pulses once with scale + shadow
- Completed steps animate checkmark draw-in
- Number fades out before checkmark appears
- All verification checks pass
- No errors or performance degradation
- Phase 2 complete (wizard flow polish finished)

# Phase 2 Plan 2: Progress Indicator Enhancements Summary

**[Substantive one-liner - what shipped]**

## Accomplishments

- Active step pulse animation (scale + shadow)
- Checkmark draw-in animation for completed steps
- Number fade-out transition before checkmark

## Files Created/Modified

- `improved/js/script.js` - JetSelector.updateProgress() with pulse and checkmark logic
- `improved/css/style.css` - Pulse shadow transition, checkmark positioning

## Decisions Made

[Key decisions and rationale, or "None"]

## Issues Encountered

[Problems and resolutions, or "None"]

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 2 complete. Ready for Phase 3: Premium Visual Design.

---

**Note for Phase 3:** Wizard now has polished animations (card stagger, loading states, progress indicators). Can focus on visual design (imagery, typography, luxury aesthetics) without animation concerns.
