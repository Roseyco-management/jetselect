**Tech stack available:**
- Motion One v11 for animations
- Playfair Display (headings) + Poppins (body) fonts loaded
- CSS custom properties system established
- AnimationManager class for future enhancements

**Established patterns:**
- CSS variables in :root for theming
- Single stylesheet architecture (style.css)
- No build process (pure CSS/HTML/JS)
- Brand colors: Teal (#115A4E), Orange (#FA692F)

**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 1: Zero-build architecture maintained (no preprocessors)
- Phase 2: Animation framework mature, focus on static visual improvements

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Typography Refinement for Luxury Hierarchy</name>
  <files>improved/css/style.css</files>
  <action>
Enhance typography for premium feel by adjusting letter-spacing, line-height, and font weights across key elements:

**Hero Typography (lines 207-221):**
- .hero-title: Increase letter-spacing to 0.02em (luxury headings need breathing room), ensure font-weight stays 700
- .hero-subtitle: Increase line-height to 1.7 (better readability), letter-spacing to 0.01em

**Section Headings (lines 384-385):**
- Section titles: Add letter-spacing: -0.01em for tighter luxury feel on Playfair Display, increase line-height to 1.3

**Body Text Refinement:**
- Increase base line-height from 1.6 to 1.75 for body text (line 57) - improves readability for long-form content
- Option cards (.option-card h3): Add letter-spacing: 0.01em, increase font-weight from 600 to 700 for better hierarchy

**Button Typography (lines 223-236):**
- .cta-button: Add letter-spacing: 0.05em for uppercase luxury feel, ensure font-weight 600

**Avoid:**
- Don't use letter-spacing > 0.1em (too spread out, loses luxury feel)
- Don't reduce font weights below current values (would feel cheap)
- Don't change font families (Playfair/Poppins already premium choices)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Visually inspect in browser - hero title should feel more spacious, subtitle more readable
2. Check that letter-spacing values are subtle (0.01-0.05em range)
3. Confirm no text overlap or layout breaks at mobile sizes
4. Verify line-heights improve readability without creating excessive whitespace
  </verify>
  <done>
- Hero typography has improved letter-spacing and line-height
- Section headings use refined spacing for luxury aesthetic
- Body text line-height increased to 1.75 for better readability
- All changes preserve responsive behavior (clamp() values intact)
- No layout breaks or visual regressions
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Image Quality & Visual Polish Enhancement</name>
  <files>improved/css/style.css, improved/images/Tot-5-edited-1.jpg</files>
  <action>
Enhance visual polish through refined shadows, gradients, and image presentation:

**Hero Image Enhancement (lines 175-186):**
- Adjust .hero::before opacity from 1.0 to 0.9 (subtle brightness boost for premium feel)
- Refine .hero-overlay gradient: Change from rgba(0,0,0,0.5-0.6) to rgba(17,90,78,0.4-0.5) - adds brand teal tint to overlay for cohesive color story

**Shadow Refinement (lines 39-42):**
- Update --shadow-lg: Change from "0 8px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)" to "0 12px 48px rgba(0,0,0,0.18)" for more dramatic luxury depth
- Update --shadow-md: Change to "0 6px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.14)" for better visual hierarchy
- Keep --shadow-sm unchanged (subtle elements)

**Button Shadow Enhancement (line 232):**
- .cta-button box-shadow: Increase from "0 8px 25px rgba(250,105,47,0.4)" to "0 10px 30px rgba(250,105,47,0.45)" for more premium button presence
- .cta-button:hover (line 241): Increase to "0 14px 40px rgba(250,105,47,0.55)"

**Card Shadow Polish (option cards, wizard cards):**
- Find .option-card and .step-container shadow values, increase depth by 20% for better elevation feel

**Image Optimization:**
- Verify Tot-5-edited-1.jpg is progressive JPEG (if not, convert using: jpegtran -copy none -progressive -optimize improved/images/Tot-5-edited-1.jpg > temp.jpg && mv temp.jpg improved/images/Tot-5-edited-1.jpg)
- Check file size stays under 40KB after optimization

**Avoid:**
- Don't add image filters like grayscale or sepia (hero image colors are already premium)
- Don't increase overlay opacity beyond 0.5 (would obscure hero image too much)
- Don't use shadows > 60px blur (becomes too soft, loses crispness)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Hero image overlay has subtle teal tint matching brand color
2. Shadows throughout site feel more dramatic and premium
3. CTA button has stronger visual presence with enhanced shadow
4. Tot-5-edited-1.jpg is progressive JPEG format
5. No visual elements feel "flat" - proper depth hierarchy established
6. Image file size ≤ 40KB (performance maintained)
  </verify>
  <done>
- Hero overlay uses brand-tinted gradient (teal rgba) instead of pure black
- Shadow system refined with increased depth for luxury feel
- Button shadows enhanced for premium interactive elements
- Hero image optimized as progressive JPEG
- File size ≤ 40KB (no performance degradation)
- Visual hierarchy improved through shadow depth differentiation
  </done>
</task>
