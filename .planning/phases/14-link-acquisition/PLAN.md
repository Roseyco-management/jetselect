# Phase 14: Link Acquisition Campaign - Comprehensive Plan

**Phase:** 14 of 15 (Link Acquisition & Authority Building)
**Timeline:** 16 weeks (4 months)
**Target:** 20-50 high-quality backlinks (DR 40+)
**Focus:** Dutch business ecosystem, aviation industry authorities, digital PR
**Budget:** €2,200-6,500

## Executive Summary

JetSelect has a unique first-mover advantage in the Netherlands private jet market with 47 pages of high-quality content. Phase 14 focuses on building a high-authority backlink profile through strategic outreach to Dutch business directories, aviation industry associations, and digital PR campaigns targeting Netherlands luxury/business media.

**Key Insight:** Competitors have thin backlink profiles dominated by basic business directories. None have secured editorial backlinks from premium business media or aviation industry publications. This represents a 12-18 month first-mover window for JetSelect to establish authority leadership.
