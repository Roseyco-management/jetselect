**Purpose:** Identify content gaps and competitive opportunities for JetSelect to exploit.

**Instructions for Data Entry (Plan 2):**

- Identify what's missing (content gaps) - topics not covered, questions not answered, formats not used
- Define "Our Angle" - how JetSelect can create superior content or differentiate
- Prioritize based on keyword value, competition level, and strategic fit
- Map to target phase (Phase 8-13) where this content should be created

**Priority Levels:**
- **P0 (Critical):** Core money keywords, must rank #1, highest ROI
- **P1 (High):** Important supporting keywords, strong ROI potential
- **P2 (Medium):** Valuable long-tail opportunities, good ROI
- **P3 (Low):** Nice to have, lower priority, accumulate over time
