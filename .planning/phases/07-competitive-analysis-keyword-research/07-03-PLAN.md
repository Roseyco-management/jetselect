**From Plan 1:**
- SerpBear tracking primary keywords
- python-seo-analyzer ready for competitor analysis
- Baseline Lighthouse audit complete

**From Plan 2:**
- 50+ keywords identified with intent classification
- 10+ competitors profiled
- Top 3 competitors have backlink sources mapped
- SERP features landscape documented

**Phase 8 needs:**
- Semantic keyword clusters
- Pillar page topics
- 100+ page content hierarchy
- Internal linking strategy

**Goal:** Translate research into content strategy roadmap

  <action>Read COMPETITORS.md to identify the top 3-5 most frequently appearing competitors across all 3 primary keywords. For each top competitor, enhance their profile with strategic analysis: 1) Content Strategy Assessment - analyze which keyword categories they target (aircraft types, locations, buying process, costs), estimate content depth (thin vs comprehensive), identify content gaps (topics they DON'T cover well). 2) Strengths Analysis - what they do well (strong on-page SEO, comprehensive guides, authoritative backlinks, SERP features owned). 3) Weaknesses/Opportunities - where they're vulnerable (missing topics, thin content, poor user intent match, outdated information, weak mobile experience). 4) Competitive Positioning - how JetSelect can differentiate (better UX, Netherlands focus, specific underserved topics). Add "Strategic Analysis" section to each top competitor's profile in COMPETITORS.md. Cross-reference KEYWORDS.md to see which keywords each competitor ranks for.</action>

For each keyword in KEYWORDS.md with Priority 1-2, create an opportunity entry in OPPORTUNITIES.md: 1) Keyword - the target keyword phrase. 2) Current Top 3 - which competitors currently rank (from SERP analysis). 3) Content Gap - what's missing from current top results (poor UX, outdated info, not Netherlands-focused, thin content, wrong intent match). 4) Our Angle - how JetSelect can create superior content (better UX, NL-specific, more comprehensive, better intent match, unique value). 5) Priority - 1-5 based on: keyword search volume estimate (high/med/low from autocomplete popularity), competition level (how strong are top 3), business value (transactional intent = higher priority), quick win potential (can we realistically rank?). 6) Target Phase - which phase should create this content (Phase 10 for pillar pages, Phase 11 for city pages, Phase 12 for aircraft pages, Phase 13 for blog/long-tail). Group opportunities by content type: Pillar Pages (core topics), City/Regional (location-based), Aircraft/Routes (product-specific), Long-tail (blog/supporting). Aim for 30-50 prioritized opportunities covering the 100+ page roadmap. Include opportunities to own SERP features (featured snippets, PAA) from SERP-FEATURES.md analysis.</action>

# Phase 7 Plan 3: Data Synthesis & Opportunity Mapping Summary

**Competitive intelligence synthesized into actionable content strategy for Phases 8-14**

## Accomplishments

- Strategic competitor analysis for top 3-5 competitors (strengths, weaknesses, differentiation opportunities)
- 30-50 prioritized content opportunities mapped to Phases 10-13
- Executive summary of competitive landscape and strategic recommendations
- Clear Phase 8 handoff with topical map direction
- Quick wins identified for immediate content opportunities

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/phases/07-competitive-analysis-keyword-research/COMPETITORS.md` - Enhanced with strategic analysis
- `.planning/phases/07-competitive-analysis-keyword-research/OPPORTUNITIES.md` - 30-50 prioritized opportunities
- `.planning/phases/07-competitive-analysis-keyword-research/EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md` - Strategic overview and recommendations

## Decisions Made

- Content architecture priorities (pillar pages, city pages, aircraft pages, long-tail)
- Competitive differentiation strategy (how JetSelect beats competitors)
- Quick win opportunities (low-hanging fruit for early ranking wins)
- Link acquisition priorities (which sources to pursue in Phase 14)

## Issues Encountered

[Document any strategic pivots, unexpected competitive dynamics, or market insights]

## Next Phase Readiness

**Phase 7 Complete** - Ready for Phase 8: Topical Map & Content Architecture

Phase 8 should focus on:
- Semantic keyword clustering based on OPPORTUNITIES.md groupings
- Pillar page architecture for [specific topics from executive summary]
- Internal linking topology design
- 100+ page sitemap creation mapped to keyword opportunities

**Alternatively:** Can continue with Phase 1 (UI/UX) - phases run in parallel per roadmap strategy.
