<objective>
Execute manual competitive research via Google.nl to gather SERP data, keyword opportunities, and backlink sources.

Purpose: Without API access, manual research provides accurate Netherlands-specific competitive intelligence that automated tools cannot. Batching all manual work maximizes efficiency.
Output: KEYWORDS.md populated with 50+ keywords, COMPETITORS.md with top 10 competitor profiles, SERP-FEATURES.md with SERP landscape, competitor backlink sources documented.

**From Plan 1:**
- SerpBear tracking: "privéjet kopen", "privéjet Nederland", "zakelijk vliegtuig kopen"
- Data templates ready: KEYWORDS.md, COMPETITORS.md, SERP-FEATURES.md
- python-seo-analyzer configured for competitor analysis

**Target keywords:**
- Primary: "privéjet kopen", "privéjet Nederland", "zakelijk vliegtuig kopen"
- Goal: Expand to 50+ keywords via autocomplete, PAA, related searches

**Research approach:** Manual Google.nl analysis (no API access), incognito mode for unbiased results

<tasks>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <action>Perform manual SERP analysis for 3 primary keywords on Google.nl</action>
  <instructions>
I've created structured templates in KEYWORDS.md, COMPETITORS.md, and SERP-FEATURES.md for data collection.

**Your task: Manual SERP Analysis**

For each of these 3 keywords:
1. "privéjet kopen"
2. "privéjet Nederland"
3. "zakelijk vliegtuig kopen"

**Steps per keyword:**

1. Open Chrome incognito window
2. Navigate to Google.nl (ensure Netherlands locale)
3. Search for the keyword
4. Analyze top 10 organic results (skip ads):

   **For each result, record in COMPETITORS.md:**
   - Domain name
   - Page title
   - Content type (guide, product page, comparison, blog)
   - Perceived content depth (thin/medium/comprehensive based on snippet)
   - User intent match (informational/transactional/navigational)

   **Record in SERP-FEATURES.md:**
   - Featured snippet present? (yes/no + which domain owns it)
   - People Also Ask questions (list all questions shown)
   - Local Pack visible? (yes/no)
   - Image Pack visible? (yes/no)
   - Video carousel visible? (yes/no)
   - Other features (knowledge panel, shopping, etc.)

5. Scroll to bottom of SERP and capture "Related searches" section - add to KEYWORDS.md

**Expected time:** ~30-45 minutes (3 keywords × 10 results each)

**Files to update:**
- `.planning/phases/07-competitive-analysis-keyword-research/COMPETITORS.md` - Add top 10 domains per keyword
- `.planning/phases/07-competitive-analysis-keyword-research/SERP-FEATURES.md` - Document SERP features per keyword
- `.planning/phases/07-competitive-analysis-keyword-research/KEYWORDS.md` - Add related search keywords (mark source as "Related: [primary keyword]")

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <action>Perform manual keyword expansion using Google autocomplete and People Also Ask</action>
  <instructions>
**Your task: Keyword Expansion**

Using Google.nl autocomplete and People Also Ask (PAA) features to expand keyword list to 50+ terms.

**Method 1: Autocomplete expansion (30-40 keywords)**

For each seed keyword pattern, record autocomplete suggestions in KEYWORDS.md:

1. **"privéjet kopen [LETTER]"** - Type each letter a-z after "privéjet kopen ", record suggestions
   - Example: "privéjet kopen a", "privéjet kopen b", etc.
   - Add unique suggestions to KEYWORDS.md (mark source as "Autocomplete: privéjet kopen")

2. **"privéjet [CITY]"** - Try major Dutch cities:
   - amsterdam, rotterdam, den haag, utrecht, eindhoven, maastricht
   - Record suggestions to KEYWORDS.md (mark source as "Autocomplete: city")

3. **"privéjet [AIRCRAFT TYPE]"**:
   - gulfstream, bombardier, cessna, embraer
   - Record suggestions (mark source as "Autocomplete: aircraft")

4. **Long-tail patterns**:
   - "kosten privéjet" (cost)
   - "tweedehands privéjet" (used)
   - "privéjet huren vs kopen" (rent vs buy)
   - Record suggestions for each

**Method 2: People Also Ask extraction (10-20 keywords)**

From PAA boxes captured in previous task:
- Extract question keywords (convert questions to keyword phrases)
- Example: "Wat kost een privéjet?" → "kosten privéjet", "prijs privéjet"
- Add to KEYWORDS.md (mark source as "PAA: [original keyword]")

**For each keyword added to KEYWORDS.md, include:**
- Keyword phrase
- Search Intent: Informational / Transactional / Navigational
- Difficulty: Low / Medium / High (subjective estimate)
- Priority: 1-5 (1=highest)
- Notes: Source and any observations

**Expected time:** ~45-60 minutes
**Target:** 50+ total keywords in KEYWORDS.md
  </instructions>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <action>Perform manual backlink source discovery for top 3 competitors</action>
  <instructions>
**Your task: Backlink Discovery**

Using Google search operators to identify quality backlink sources competitors use.

**Top 3 competitors to analyze:**
(Use the 3 most frequently appearing domains from your SERP analysis in COMPETITORS.md)

**For each competitor:**

1. **Find who links to them:**
   - Google search: `"competitor-domain.com" -site:competitor-domain.com`
   - Example: `"privatejetbroker.nl" -site:privatejetbroker.nl`
   - Document top 10-15 linking domains

2. **Check common link sources:**

   **Dutch Business Directories:**
   - Search: `site:kvk.nl "privéjet"` (Chamber of Commerce)
   - Search: `site:bedrijvengids.nl "private jet"`
   - Note which competitors are listed

   **Aviation Industry:**
   - Search: `site:lvnl.nl` (Dutch air traffic control)
   - Search: `site:easa.europa.eu`
   - Check for industry listings

   **Media/Publications:**
   - Search: `site:fd.nl "privéjet"` (Financieele Dagblad)
   - Search: `site:elitetraveler.com "netherlands"`
   - Note competitor mentions

3. **Categorize each backlink source:**
   - Directory (business listing)
   - Editorial (article/mention)
   - Partnership (affiliate/referral)
   - Authority (government/industry body)

**Update COMPETITORS.md:**
Add "Link Sources" section for each of the 3 competitors analyzed, listing:
- Domain of link source
- Link type (directory/editorial/partnership/authority)
- Relevance score: 1-5 (5=highly relevant to private jets)
- Difficulty to replicate: Easy / Medium / Hard

**Expected time:** ~45-60 minutes (3 competitors)
**Target:** 10-15 quality link sources identified per competitor
